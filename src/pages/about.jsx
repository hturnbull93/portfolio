      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        I am a Front End developer, looking for new opportunities to work with a
        team of passionate, smart people, working to build useful apps that
        consumers enjoy using.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am self-trained and have been working as a freelancer web designer for
        the past three years. I'm passionate about the intersection of
        technology and creativity. This led me to train at
        <a href="https://makers.tech/">Makers Academy</a>
        (London's leading programming bootcamp), to learn best practices, tools
        and methodologies, and become a professional Front End Developer.
