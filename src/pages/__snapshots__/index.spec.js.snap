    <p>
      I am a Full Stack developer, looking for opportunities to continue to learn, challenge myself and work with great people to build useful apps that consumers enjoy using.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm passionate about the intersection of technology and creativity. I am self-taught and have been working as a Web Designer for the past three years, which has allowed me to gain skills in Front-End design and implementation, as well as UI/UX design.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have recently completed training at
       
      <a

      >
        Makers Academy
      </a>
       (London's leading programming bootcamp), to learn best practices, tools and methodologies.
