This is a commercial project for The Nursery Theatre Ltd.

I redeveloped their website in mid 2019, creating designs from their new branding guidelines.

WordPress is the CMS of choice, as their administrative staff are familiar with it from maintaining their previous site.

The work centers around the style, but I did implement small bits of custom functionality with JS and PHP where plugins wouldn't quite get the job done.

I also maintain technical documents for updating the site's content via the WordPress admin dashboard, to make sure any user can add content in a manner consistent with their style.
