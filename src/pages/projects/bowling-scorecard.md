An immersive bowling scorecard, based on the classic coding kata, completed over the course of a weekend.

I approached the game logic using Test Driven Development and Object Oriented principles.

The interface was implemented using jQuery to write the scores and running total into the scorecard.

The scorecards design was inspired by real life 1950's scorecards, and the immersive ambience aspect by one of my favourite films, The Big Lebowski.
