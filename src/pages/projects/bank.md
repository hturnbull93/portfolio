These are a series of Tech Tests, demonstrating best practices in Test Driven Development, Object Oriented Design principles, and Agile/XP methods.

In summary, the program allows you to create an account, deposit funds into it, withdraw funds from it, and print statements.

I completed four separate implementations, in three languages, over the course of a week.

Implementations are in [Ruby](https://github.com/hturnbull93/bank), [JavaScript for the browser](https://github.com/hturnbull93/bank-js), [Node.js](https://github.com/hturnbull93/bank-node), and [Python](https://github.com/hturnbull93/bank-py).

The specific requirements, instructions, and full documentation of the development process is available in the READMEs of these projects.
